tachycardia.py contains one function: is_tachycardic(). It takes a string input and assesses whether it is reasonably close to the word "tachycardic" by converting to lowercase, removing leading and trailing spaces, then using the Levenshtein distance to compare string closeness.

#To run:
Type is_tachycardic("input") into the command line
